16-Bit ALU Design: Behavioral vs. Hardware-Oriented Implementation
This repository contains the design, simulation, and synthesis of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing eight distinct operations. The project explores the trade-offs between a behavioral coding style and a hardware-oriented (structural) approach in terms of gate utilization and propagation delay.
